# BasicNoteIOS
## Introdution
I am beginner of Swift IOS.

This is basic todo/note App based on Swift 5, Xcode 14. 

I apply the MVVM Architecture to this project.

I coded this based on these series:
* [SwiftUI Todo List (Beginner Level)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEf1YS4vyW8&list=PLwvDm4VfkdpheGqemblOIA7v3oq0MS30i&index=1).
* [How to store an Image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3LofRLPUM8).

## Main Feature
* Create note, included image.
* Display notes.
* Save to and read from local storage(In ios, it called User Defaults).
* Toggle done/undone notes.
* Delete note.
* Sort notes.
* Filter notes.
* Search notes by query.
